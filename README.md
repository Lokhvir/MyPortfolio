# Portfolio

I don't really know what I write in this read me file so I'll just put a to do list of things to make the portfolio look better.

Also, I'ts an amateur portfolio for now but it's what I got.


Thing on my to do list:

1 - Add images of my cats as a dropdown menu style when hovering over their names.

2 - Fix the id targeting of anchors

3 - Add new projects and change the layout.
